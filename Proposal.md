### Project Title

Unlocking the Mystery: Are NYC Students’ Weights Telling a Hidden Story?

### Motivation

The motivation for our project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis to
understand the multifactorial dimensions of New York state student
health, specifically relating to obesity and overweight prevalence. Our
project will seek to establish correlations between access to food
availability, demographic variables, and weight status to better
understand the impact of social determinants on student health outcomes.
Insights gained from this analysis will be instrumental in informing
public health interventions, educational policies, and community-based
programs to promote healthier lifestyles and address the obesity
epidemic in New York City.

### Intended Final Products

Our project will develop a web platform designed for the exploration of
intrinsic connections between the weight status of New York state
students and their demographic characteristics. A multifaceted
correlation analysis will be conducted to comprehensively analyze each
demographic variable, including causal inferences, regression analyses,
and hypothesis testing. Subsequently, the outcomes will be presented in
the form of interactive graphs and tabulated data for enhanced
accessibility and clarity. Furthermore, a narrated screencast will
provide an intuitive overview of the final product, offering an in-depth
understanding of the research findings and their implications.

### Anticipated Data Source

NY state demographic data:
<https://pad.human.cornell.edu/schools/datadownload.cfm> Student Weight
Status in NY state:
<https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Student-Weight-Status-Category-Reporting-Results-B/es3k-2aus>

### Planned Analysis/Visualization/Coding Challenges

The exploratory analysis will look at the average overweight rates among
New York state students based on their gender, race, grade level, and
county, as well as changes in overweight rates from 2015 to 2019. For
statistical analysis, we plan to perform multiple linear regression to
predict student overweight percentages in a specific area of NY state
based on factors such as poverty or race. An ANOVA test will also be
used to compare the average number of overweight students across racial
groups and then use Tukey HSD to help identify which groups differ
significantly. To visualize our results, we plan to use interactive
graphs and tables, including bar charts, scatterplots, and line plots.
We anticipate potential coding challenges related to data joining,
particularly in mapping school district number to county or borough
variables, and selecting relevant years for the analysis.

### Project Title
Unlocking the Mystery: Are NY State Students' Weights Telling a Hidden Story?

### Motivation
The motivation for our project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand the multifactorial dimensions of New York state student health, specifically relating to obesity and overweight prevalence. Our project will seek to establish correlations between access to food availability, demographic variables, and weight status to better understand the impact of social determinants on student health outcomes. Insights gained from this analysis will be instrumental in informing public health interventions, educational policies, and community-based programs to promote healthier lifestyles and address the obesity epidemic in New York state. 

### Intended Final Products
Our project will develop a web platform designed for the exploration of intrinsic connections between the weight status of New York state students and their demographic characteristics. A multifaceted correlation analysis will be conducted to comprehensively analyze each demographic variable, including causal inferences, regression analyses, and hypothesis testing. Subsequently, the outcomes will be presented in the form of interactive graphs and tabulated data for enhanced accessibility and clarity. Furthermore, a narrated screencast will provide an intuitive overview of the final product, offering an in-depth understanding of the research findings and their implications.

### Anticipated Data Source
NY state demographic data:
https://pad.human.cornell.edu/schools/datadownload.cfm
Student Weight Status in NY state: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Student-Weight-Status-Category-Reporting-Results-B/es3k-2aus 

### Planned Analysis/Visualization/Coding Challenges 
The exploratory analysis will look at the average overweight rates among New York state students based on their gender, race, grade level, and county, as well as changes in overweight rates from 2015 to 2019. For statistical analysis, we plan to perform multiple linear regression to predict student overweight percentages in a specific area of NY state based on factors such as poverty or race. An ANOVA test will also be used to compare the average number of overweight students across racial groups and then use Tukey HSD to help identify which groups differ significantly. To visualize our results, we plan to use interactive graphs and tables, including bar charts, scatterplots, and line plots. We anticipate potential coding challenges related to data joining, particularly in mapping school district number to county or borough variables, and selecting relevant years for the analysis.
